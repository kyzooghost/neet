# There are two wooden sticks of lengths A and B respectively. Each stick can be cut into multiple shorter sticks of integer lengths. Your goal is to construct the largest possible square. To do this, you must cut four sticks of the same length (note that there can be some leftover pieces). What is the longest side of the square that you can achieve?

# Find and fix a bug in the given implementation of a function: def solution (A, B) that, given two integers A and B, returns the side length of the largest square that you can obtain. If it is not possible to create any square, the function should return 0.

# Examples:
# 1. Given A = 10, B = 21, the function should return 7. You can split the second stick into three sticks of length 7 and shorten the first stick by 3. 
# 2. Given A = 13, B = 11, the function should return 5. You can cut two sticks of length 5 from each of the given sticks.
# The attached code is still incorrect for some inputs. Despite the error(s), the code may produce a correct answer for the example test cases. The goal of the exercise is to find and fix the bug(s) in the implementation. You can modify at most one line.

# Assume that:
# â€¢ A and B are integers within the range [1..100,000].
